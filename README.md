# Monog DB data base nightly back up using [node-cron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron) with the help of (spawn())[https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html] child process.

## How to use **child-process** in Nodejs.

Each of the methods i.e. `exec execFile spawn & fork` is explained in this repo - with their respective file names.

- (**exec**)[https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html] - The exec() function creates a new shell and executes a given command. The output from the execution is buffered, which means kept in memory, and is available for use in a callback.

- (**execFile**)[https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html] - execFile() : similar to child_process. exec() except that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by default. child_process. fork() : spawns a new Node.

- (**spawn**)[https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html] - spawn() used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes. Like child_process.â€‹spawn() , a ChildProcess object is returned.

- (**fork**)[https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html] - fork() method: The child_process. fork() is a special case of child_process. spawn() where the parent and the child process can communicate with each other via send(). The fork() allows separation of computation-intensive tasks from the main event loop.

## [node-cron](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron)

The (node-cron)[https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron] module is tiny task scheduler in pure JavaScript for node.js based on GNU crontab. This module allows you to schedule task in node.js using full crontab syntax.

### ES Modules in Node

We us ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error.

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like.

### Execution steps

```
### Install Dependencies
